This repository contains a collection of JavaScript coding exercises that demonstrate various concepts and techniques. The exercises are designed to help practice and improve my JavaScript skills.

**Part 1: Logging Names and Provinces**
In this exercise, we use the forEach() method to log each name and each province to the console.

**Part 2: Uppercase Provinces**
In this exercise, we use the map() method to create a new array of province names in all uppercase and log the new array to the console.

**Part 3: Name Lengths**
In this exercise, we use the map() method to create a new array that contains the length of each name and log the new array to the console.

**Part 4: Alphabetical Provinces**
In this exercise, we use the sort() method to alphabetically sort the provinces and log the sorted array to the console.

**Part 5: Provinces without "Cape"**
In this exercise, we use the filter() method to remove provinces containing "Cape" and log the count of remaining provinces.

**Part 6: Names Containing "S"**
In this exercise, we use the map() method to create a boolean array that determines if a name contains the letter "S" and log the boolean array to the console. We also use the some() method to return one boolean value after using some() on the return.

**Part 7: Name and Province Object**
In this exercise, we use the reduce() method to transform the names array into an object mapping names to their respective provinces and log the object to the console.

### Advanced Exercises

**Part 1: Product Names**
In this exercise, we use the map() method to iterate over the products array and log each product name to the console.

**Part 2: Products with Short Names**
In this exercise, we use the filter() method to filter out products with names longer than 5 characters and log the filtered array to the console.

**Part 3: Total Price**
In this exercise, we use the filter() method to filter out products without prices, convert string prices to numbers, and calculate the total price using reduce().

**Part 4: Product Name String**
In this exercise, we use the reduce() method to concatenate all product names into a single string with and without white spaces in between.
#### Advanced Exercises (Single `console.log` Execution)
For these exercises, wrap your logic in a single `console.log` statement:
